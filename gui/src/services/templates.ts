  Policy set or a policy with "unsafe-eval" enabled. This exposes users of
  this app to unnecessary security risks.

For more information and help, consult
https://electronjs.org/docs/tutorial/security.

chunk-SOPOILPT.js?v=4dc05751:521 Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, `e00faa62-76c1-486b-ba2c-b65b069e8b28`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
